    "content":"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section generally discusses fiscal 2024 and 2023 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included herein. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for that discussion. Overview The Company is a global leader in providing Enterprise Asset Intelligence (\u201cEAI\u201d) offerings in the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (\u201cAIDC\u201d) industry. The AIDC market consists of mobile computing, data capture, radio frequency identification devices (\u201cRFID\u201d), barcode printing, and other workflow automation offerings. The Company\u2019s operations consist of two reportable segments that provide complementary offerings to our customers: Asset Intelligence & Tracking (\u201cAIT\u201d) and Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (\u201cEVM\u201d). Refer to Part I, Item 1 of this document for additional information. \u2022 The AIT segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies. Its major product lines include barcode and card printers, RFID and RTLS offerings, and supplies, including temperature-monitoring labels, and services. \u2022 The EVM segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture offerings. Its major product lines include mobile computing, data capture, fixed industrial scanning and machine vision, services, and workflow optimization solutions. Our workflow optimization solutions include cloud-based software subscriptions, retail solutions, and robotic automation solutions. 2024 Financial Summary and Other Recent Developments \u2022 Net sales were $4,981 million in the current year compared to $4,584 million in the prior year. \u2022 Operating income was $742 million in the current year compared to $481 million in the prior year. \u2022 Net income was $528 million, or $10.18 per diluted share in the current year, compared to Net income of $296 million, or $5.72 per diluted share in the prior year. \u2022 Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,013 million in the current year compared to net cash used in operating activities of $4 million in the prior year. As we entered 2024, we saw the stabilization of distributor inventory levels in both of our segments and the beginning of a modest recovery in demand trends in certain of our offerings within our EVM segment. The demand trend recovery broadened across offerings within both segments beginning in the second half of the year contributing to improved revenue and profitability. As we look ahead to 2025, we expect increased uncertainty and volatility in global trade policy and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company completed its actions under the 2022 Productivity Plan in the current year. Total charges associated with the 2022 Productivity Plan and the U.S. voluntary retirement plan (\u201cVRP\u201d), which was completed in 2023, were $127\u00a0million, including $17\u00a0million recorded in the current year. The costs of these actions are classified within Exit and restructuring on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Together, these programs have impacted over 9% of our global employee base and have generated approximately $120 million of annualized net cost savings, primarily within Operating expenses. In the second quarter, the Company completed a private offering of $500 million senior unsecured notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) with a 6.5% fixed interest rate; the proceeds of which, were partially used to repay outstanding debt. Additionally, with the issuance of the fixed rate Senior Notes, the Company terminated its interest rate swap agreements which were intended to result in a fixed interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt. On December 27, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Photoneo, a leading developer and manufacturer of 3D machine vision offerings. The purchase price of approximately \u20ac60\u00a0million is expected to be funded with cash on hand. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. The acquired business will become part of the EVM segment. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations: Year Ended 2024 versus 2023 and Year Ended 2023 versus 2022 Consolidated Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2024 vs 2023 Percent Change 2023 vs 2022 2024 2023 2022 Net sales: Tangible products $ 4,016 $ 3,665 $ 4,915 9.6 % (25.4) % Services and software 965 919 866 5.0 % 6.1 % Total Net sales 4,981 4,584 5,781 8.7 % (20.7) % Gross profit 2,413 2,123 2,624 13.7 % (19.1) % Gross margin 48.4 % 46.3 % 45.4 % 210 bps 90 bps Operating expenses 1,671 1,642 2,095 1.8 % (21.6) % Operating income $ 742 $ 481 $ 529 54.3 % (9.1) % Net sales to customers by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2024 vs 2023 Percent Change 2023 vs 2022 2024 2023 2022 North America $ 2,547 $ 2,405 $ 2,919 5.9 % (17.6) % EMEA 1,617 1,414 1,920 14.4 % (26.4) % Asia-Pacific 490 481 609 1.9 % (21.0) % Latin America 327 284 333 15.1 % (14.7) % Total Net sales $ 4,981 $ 4,584 $ 5,781 8.7 % (20.7) % Operating expenses are summarized below (amounts in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, As a Percentage of Net sales 2024 2023 2022 2024 2023 2022 Selling and marketing $ 600 $ 581 $ 607 12.0 % 12.7 % 10.5 % Research and development 563 519 570 11.3 % 11.3 % 9.9 % General and administrative 381 334 375 7.6 % 7.3 % 6.5 % Settlement and related costs \u2014 \u2014 372 \u2014 % \u2014 % 6.4 % Amortization of intangible assets 104 104 136 NM NM NM Acquisition and integration costs 6 6 21 NM NM NM Exit and restructuring costs 17 98 14 NM NM NM Total Operating expenses $ 1,671 $ 1,642 $ 2,095 33.5 % 35.8 % 36.2 % Consolidated Organic Net sales growth (decline): Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Reported GAAP Consolidated Net sales growth (decline) 8.7 % (20.7) % Adjustments: Impact of foreign currency translations (1) (0.6) % 1.4 % Impact of acquisitions (2) \u2014 % (0.5) % Consolidated Organic Net sales growth (decline) (3) 8.1 % (19.8) % (1) Operating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period as well as removing realized cash flow hedge gains and losses from both the current and prior year periods. 31 Table of Contents (2) For purposes of computing Organic Net sales growth (decline), amounts directly attributable to business acquisitions are excluded for twelve months following their respective acquisitions. (3) Consolidated Organic Net sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item. 2024 compared to 2023 Total Net sales increased $397 million or 8.7% compared to the prior year reflecting growth in our EVM segment that was partially offset by a slight decline in our AIT segment as the current year recovery in demand trends benefited EVM earlier in the year than AIT. Excluding the effects of foreign currency changes and acquisitions, Consolidated Organic Net sales increased by 8.1%. Gross margin increased to 48.4% for the current year compared to 46.3% in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to volume leverage, higher service and software margins, lower freight rates, and lower inventory-related charges. Gross margin was higher in both segments, particularly EVM. Operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $1,671 million and $1,642 million, or 33.5% and 35.8% of Net sales, respectively. Current year Operating expenses were higher than the prior year primarily due to higher incentive compensation, partially offset by lower Exit and restructuring costs and incremental savings largely attributed to our Exit and restructuring actions. Operating income was $742 million for the current year compared to $481 million for the prior year. The increase was due to higher Gross profit partially offset by higher Operating expenses. Net income increased 78.4% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher Operating income, as described above, as well as lower Interest (expense) income, net which included higher interest rate swap gains and interest income in the current year. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 16.9% and 11.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower rate benefits from tax credits and discrete items as well as higher state income taxes. Diluted earnings per share increased to $10.18 as compared to $5.72 in the prior year primarily due to higher Net income. Results of Operations by Segment The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each reportable business segment as detailed in Note 20, Segment Information & Geographic Data in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent applicable, segment operating income excludes Amortization of intangible assets, Acquisition and integration costs, Exit and restructuring costs, as well as certain other non-recurring costs (such as the Settlement costs in 2022, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, and business acquisition purchase accounting adjustments). Asset Intelligence & Tracking Segment (\u201cAIT\u201d) (amounts in millions, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2024 vs 2023 Percent Change 2023 vs 2022 2024 2023 2022 Net sales: Tangible products $ 1,532 $ 1,537 $ 1,728 (0.3) % (11.1) % Services and software 115 114 109 0.9 % 4.6 Total Net sales 1,647 1,651 1,837 (0.2) % (10.1) % Gross profit 793 787 795 0.8 % (1.0) % Gross margin 48.1 % 47.7 % 43.3 % 40 bps 440 bps Operating expenses 458 441 434 3.9 % 1.6 % Operating income $ 335 $ 346 $ 361 (3.2) % (4.2) % 32 Table of Contents AIT Organic Net sales (decline): Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 AIT Reported GAAP Net sales (decline) (0.2) % (10.1) % Adjustments: Impact of foreign currency translations (1) (0.7) % 1.3 % AIT Organic Net sales (decline) (2) (0.9) % (8.8) % (1) Operating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period as well as removing realized cash flow hedge gains and losses from both the current and prior year periods. (2) AIT Organic Net sales (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item. 2024 compared to 2023 Total Net sales for AIT decreased $4 million or 0.2% compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales of printing products and supplies, partially offset by favorable foreign currency changes and higher sales of RFID products. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, AIT Organic Net sales decreased by 0.9%. Gross margin increased to 48.1% in the current year compared to 47.7% for the prior year primarily due to favorable foreign currency changes, partially offset by higher inventory-related charges. Operating income decreased 3.2% in the current year compared to the prior year due to higher Operating expenses partially offset by higher Gross profit. Enterprise Visibility & Mobility Segment (\u201cEVM\u201d) (amounts in millions, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2024 vs 2023 Percent Change 2023 vs 2022 2024 2023 2022 Net sales: Tangible products $ 2,484 $ 2,128 $ 3,187 16.7 % (33.2) % Services and software 850 805 757 5.6 % 6.3 % Total Net sales 3,334 2,933 3,944 13.7 % (25.6) % Gross profit 1,620 1,336 1,829 21.3 % (27.0) % Gross margin 48.6 % 45.6 % 46.4 % 300 bps (80) bps Operating expenses 1,086 993 1,118 9.4 % (11.2) % Operating income $ 534 $ 343 $ 711 55.7 % (51.8) % EVM Organic Net sales growth (decline): Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 EVM Reported GAAP Net sales growth (decline) 13.7 % (25.6) % Adjustments: Impact of foreign currency translations (1) (0.5) % 1.5 % Impact of acquisitions (2) \u2014 % (0.8) % EVM Organic Net sales growth (decline) (3) 13.2 % (24.9) % (1) Operating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by 33 Table of Contents translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period as well as removing realized cash flow hedge gains and losses from both the current and prior year periods. (2) For purposes of computing EVM Organic Net sales growth (decline), amounts directly attributable to business acquisitions are excluded for twelve months following their respective acquisitions. (3) EVM Organic Net sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item. 2024 compared to 2023 Total Net sales for EVM increased $401 million or 13.7% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales of mobile computing products, and services and software, partially offset by lower sales of data capture products. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency changes and acquisitions, EVM Organic Net sales increased by 13.2%. Gross margin increased to 48.6% in the current year compared to 45.6% for the prior year primarily due to volume leverage, favorable business mix, higher service and software margins, lower inventory-related charges, and lower freight rates. Operating income for the current year increased 55.7% compared to the prior year due to higher Gross profit partially offset by higher Operating expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary factors that influence our liquidity include the amount and timing of cash collections from our customers, cash payments to our suppliers, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and share repurchases. Management believes that our existing capital resources, inclusive of available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities and funds generated from operations, are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness. The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years indicated (in millions): Year Ended December\u00a031, $ Change 2024 vs 2023 $ Change 2023 vs 2022 2024 2023 2022 Cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,013 $ (4) $ 488 $ 1,017 $ (492) Investing activities (57) (92) (968) 35 876 Financing activities (190) 117 253 (307) (136) Effect of exchange rates on cash balances (3) \u2014 \u2014 (3) \u2014 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ 763 $ 21 $ (227) $ 742 $ 248 2024 vs. 2023 The change in our cash and cash equivalents balance during the current year is reflective of the following: \u2022 $1,017 million change in operating activities primarily due to the timing of cash payments and the reduction of overall inventory levels, lower legal settlement, income tax, and employee incentive compensation payments, higher cash receipts on interest rate swaps attributed to the termination of those agreements, as well as overall improved operating profits. \u2022 $307 million change in financing activities primarily due to current year net debt repayments as a portion of the recently issued Senior Notes was utilized to reduce total debt, compared to net borrowings in the prior year. 34 Table of Contents Company Debt The following table shows the carrying value of the Company\u2019s debt (in millions): December 31, 2024 2023 Term Loan A $ 1,575 $ 1,684 Senior Notes 500 \u2014 Revolving Credit Facility \u2014 413 Receivables Financing Facilities 108 129 Total debt $ 2,183 $ 2,226 Less: Debt issuance costs (9) (2) Less: Unamortized discounts (3) (4) Less: Current portion of debt (79) (173) Total long-term debt $ 2,092 $ 2,047 Term Loan A The principal on Term Loan A is due in quarterly installments, with the next quarterly installment due in the second quarter of 2026 and the majority due upon maturity in 2027. The Company has and may make prepayments in whole or in part, without premium or penalty; and would be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Term Loan A interest rate was 5.71%. Interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin. Senior Notes In the second quarter of 2024, the Company completed a private offering of $500\u00a0million senior unsecured notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) with a 6.5% fixed interest rate. The net proceeds of the issuance, after deducting debt issuance costs which were deferred, were approximately $492\u00a0million. The Senior Notes mature on June\u00a01, 2032, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December of each year, commencing on December 1, 2024. The Company may make prepayments in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and would be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of Zebra\u2019s existing and future subsidiaries. The Senior Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of Zebra to: (i) grant or incur liens; (ii) have its subsidiaries guarantee debt without becoming guarantors; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of its assets. Revolving Credit Facility The Company has a Revolving Credit Facility that is available for working capital and other general business purposes, including letters of credit. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Company had letters of credit totaling $10 million, which reduced funds available for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1,500 million to $1,490 million. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility had an average interest rate of 5.68%.\u00a0Upon borrowing, interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on May\u00a025, 2027. Receivables Financing Facility As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Company has a Receivables Financing Facility with a borrowing limit of up to $180 million. As collateral, the Company pledges perfected first-priority security interests in its U.S. domestically originated accounts receivable. The Company has accounted for transactions under this facility as secured borrowings. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company amended this facility to extend the maturity to March\u00a019, 2027 but otherwise did not substantially change the terms of the facility. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $638 million of gross receivables that were pledged under the facility. As of December\u00a031, 2024, $108 million had been borrowed, of which $79 million was classified as current. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of\u00a0December\u00a031, 2024, the facility had an average interest rate of\u00a05.38%. Interest is paid monthly on these borrowings. See Note 12, Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Company\u2019s debt instruments. 35 Table of Contents Receivables Factoring The Company has a Receivables Factoring arrangement, pursuant to which certain receivables originated from the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions up to a maximum of \u20ac75\u00a0million, as amended, are sold to a bank without recourse in exchange for cash. Transactions under the Receivables Factoring arrangement are accounted for as sales and the related receivables are removed from the Company\u2019s balance sheet. The Company does not maintain any beneficial interest in the receivables sold. The bank\u2019s purchase of eligible receivables is subject to a maximum amount of uncollected receivables. The Company services the receivables on behalf of the bank, but otherwise maintains no significant continuing involvement with respect to the receivables. Sale proceeds that are representative of the fair value of factored receivables, less a factoring fee, are reflected in Cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while sale proceeds in excess of the fair value of factored receivables are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, there were a total of $28 million and $56 million, respectively, of uncollected receivables that had been sold and removed from the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As servicer of sold receivables, the Company had $51 million and $112 million of obligations that were not yet remitted to the bank as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These obligations are included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in such obligations reflected within Cash flows from financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 19, Accounts Receivable Factoring in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Share Repurchases On May 17, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $1 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock. The authorized share repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date.\u00a0The level of the Company\u2019s repurchases depends on a number of factors, including its financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors its management may deem relevant. The timing, volume, and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases may be affected from time to time through open market purchases, including pursuant to a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, the Company repurchased 130,560 shares of common stock for approximately $47 million. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Company has cumulatively repurchased 539,574 shares of common stock for approximately $154 million, resulting in a remaining amount of share repurchases authorized under the plans of $846 million. Subsequent to the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, the Company has repurchased 128,466 shares of common stock for approximately $50 million through February\u00a06, 2025. Future Cash Requirements We believe that our Cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $901 million as of December\u00a031, 2024, along with anticipated cash generation from operations and available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities, will be sufficient to fund the Company\u2019s cash requirements during the next 12 months and thereafter based on our current business plans. Included in the Company\u2019s Cash and cash equivalents are amounts held by foreign subsidiaries, which was $52 million and $33 million as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We do not expect that Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries will need to be repatriated to fund the Company\u2019s U.S. operations based on current cash requirements. Our cash requirements during the next 12 months and thereafter include payments to satisfy the following obligations: \u2022 Purchase obligations \u2014 The Company has a limited number of multi-year purchase commitments, primarily related to semiconductors and cloud services, which contain minimum purchase requirements and are non-cancellable. As of December\u00a031, 2024, these multi-year commitments were approximately $138 million. This amount excludes routine purchase orders for goods and services, as well as amounts already reflected within Current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 14, Accrued Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. \u2022 Debt obligations \u2014 We expect to make total payments of approximately $210 million associated with the Company\u2019s debt facilities in 2025. This expected use of cash is based on the Company\u2019s current borrowings and applicable interest rates and margins as of December\u00a031, 2024, and includes principal and interest payments. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may decide to borrow additional amounts or repay principal earlier than contractually owed, which would affect future cash payments. See Note 12, Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Company\u2019s debt facilities. 36 Table of Contents \u2022 Leases obligations \u2014 We lease various manufacturing and repair facilities, distribution centers, research facilities, sales and administrative offices, equipment, and vehicles. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Company\u2019s fixed lease commitments totaled $233 million, of which $46 million is payable in 2025. See Note 13, Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Company\u2019s lease arrangements. In addition to the expected cash requirements described above, the Company may use cash to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, or repurchase common stock under its share repurchase program. We also expect to spend approximately $60 million to $70 million on capital expenditures in 2025. Critical Accounting Estimates Management prepared the consolidated financial statements of the Company under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The application of these principles requires the use of estimates which affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. While we believe that our estimates are reasonable based upon available information, actual results could differ substantially from those estimates. Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional discussion of these items along with other significant accounting policies of the Company. The accounting estimates described below have been identified by Management as those that are most significant to our financial statements. Income Taxes We estimate a provision or benefit for income taxes and amounts to be settled or recovered in several tax jurisdictions globally. Our estimates are complex and involve significant judgments and interpretations of regulations. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for several years after completion of a given year. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis, which requires estimation of our ability to generate future taxable income. In particular, our income tax provision or benefit is dependent on our ability to forecast future taxable income in the U.S., U.K., Singapore, and other jurisdictions. Significant judgments included in our forecasts include projecting future sales volumes and pricing, costs to manufacture and procure products and to deliver offerings, among other factors. There were no significant changes in estimates to our income tax provision during the current year. Acquisitions We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that the purchase price be allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The estimates used to determine the fair values of long-lived intangible assets can be complex and require judgment. We generally value intangible assets using income-based valuation methodologies, such as the excess earnings method, which require critical estimates that include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from revenues and the determination of discount rates. Goodwill Impairment Our goodwill impairment testing includes a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value. Fair value determinations require judgment and can be sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, as well as market factors. We estimate the fair value of reporting units using both income and market-based valuation approaches. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires that we make assumptions and estimates including projections of revenue and income growth rates as well as cash flows; capital investments; competitive and customer trends; appropriate peer group selection; market-based discount rates and other market factors. Our annual impairment testing, most recently completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, continues to indicate that the fair values of each of our reporting units significantly exceed their respective carrying values. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised offerings to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive. The consideration that we expect to receive is estimated by reflecting reductions to our transaction price for product returns, rebates, and other incentives. These estimates are developed using the expected value that the Company anticipates receiving and are based on recent trends observed in similar transactions. Additionally, some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, including various hardware, software, and\/or services. For such contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the estimated total transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices (\u201cSSP\u201d). The determination of SSP is established at a regional level. SSP is based on observable prices in recent standalone transactions for the same or similar offerings, to the extent available, which is often applicable to tangible products and software licenses. Alternatively, in the absence of recent observable prices, the Company generally applies the expected cost-plus margin approach to professional services, repair and maintenance services, and solution offerings. There were no changes to our estimation processes for consideration received or SSP that materially affected revenues during the year. 37 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements. Non-GAAP Measures The Company has provided reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures \u2013 Consolidated Organic Net sales growth (decline), AIT Organic Net sales (decline), and EVM Organic Net sales growth (decline) \u2013 are presented because our management evaluates our financial results both including and excluding the effects of business acquisitions and foreign currency translation, as applicable. Management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of our business from period to period and trends in our historical operating results.

Management Discussion and Analysis Text:**\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This section generally discusses fiscal 2024 and 2023 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included herein. Refer to \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for that discussion. Overview The Company is a global leader in providing Enterprise Asset Intelligence (\u201cEAI\u201d) offerings in the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (\u201cAIDC\u201d) industry. The AIDC market consists of mobile computing, data capture, radio frequency identification devices (\u201cRFID\u201d), barcode printing, and other workflow automation offerings. The Company\u2019s operations consist of two reportable segments that provide complementary offerings to our customers: Asset Intelligence & Tracking (\u201cAIT\u201d) and Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (\u201cEVM\u201d). Refer to Part I, Item 1 of this document for additional information. \u2022 The AIT segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies. Its major product lines include barcode and card printers, RFID and RTLS offerings, and supplies, including temperature-monitoring labels, and services. \u2022 The EVM segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture offerings. Its major product lines include mobile computing, data capture, fixed industrial scanning and machine vision, services, and workflow optimization solutions. Our workflow optimization solutions include cloud-based software subscriptions, retail solutions, and robotic automation solutions. 2024 Financial Summary and Other Recent Developments \u2022 Net sales were $4,981 million in the current year compared to $4,584 million in the prior year. \u2022 Operating income was $742 million in the current year compared to $481 million in the prior year. \u2022 Net income was $528 million, or $10.18 per diluted share in the current year, compared to Net income of $296 million, or $5.72 per diluted share in the prior year. \u2022 Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,013 million in the current year compared to net cash used in operating activities of $4 million in the prior year. As we entered 2024, we saw the stabilization of distributor inventory levels in both of our segments and the beginning of a modest recovery in demand trends in certain of our offerings within our EVM segment. The demand trend recovery broadened across offerings within both segments beginning in the second half of the year contributing to improved revenue and profitability. As we look ahead to 2025, we expect increased uncertainty and volatility in global trade policy and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company completed its actions under the 2022 Productivity Plan in the current year. Total charges associated with the 2022 Productivity Plan and the U.S. voluntary retirement plan (\u201cVRP\u201d), which was completed in 2023, were $127\u00a0million, including $17\u00a0million recorded in the current year. The costs of these actions are classified within Exit and restructuring on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Together, these programs have impacted over 9% of our global employee base and have generated approximately $120 million of annualized net cost savings, primarily within Operating expenses. In the second quarter, the Company completed a private offering of $500 million senior unsecured notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) with a 6.5% fixed interest rate; the proceeds of which, were partially used to repay outstanding debt. Additionally, with the issuance of the fixed rate Senior Notes, the Company terminated its interest rate swap agreements which were intended to result in a fixed interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt. On December 27, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Photoneo, a leading developer and manufacturer of 3D machine vision offerings. The purchase price of approximately \u20ac60\u00a0million is expected to be funded with cash on hand. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. The acquired business will become part of the EVM segment. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations: Year Ended 2024 versus 2023 and Year Ended 2023 versus 2022 Consolidated Results of Operations (amounts in millions, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2024 vs 2023 Percent Change 2023 vs 2022 2024 2023 2022 Net sales: Tangible products $ 4,016 $ 3,665 $ 4,915 9.6 % (25.4) % Services and software 965 919 866 5.0 % 6.1 % Total Net sales 4,981 4,584 5,781 8.7 % (20.7) % Gross profit 2,413 2,123 2,624 13.7 % (19.1) % Gross margin 48.4 % 46.3 % 45.4 % 210 bps 90 bps Operating expenses 1,671 1,642 2,095 1.8 % (21.6) % Operating income $ 742 $ 481 $ 529 54.3 % (9.1) % Net sales to customers by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, Percent Change 2024 vs 2023 Percent Change 2023 vs 2022 2024 2023 2022 North America $ 2,547 $ 2,405 $ 2,919 5.9 % (17.6) % EMEA 1,617 1,414 1,920 14.4 % (26.4) % Asia-Pacific 490 481 609 1.9 % (21.0) % Latin America 327 284 333 15.1 % (14.7) % Total Net sales $ 4,981 $ 4,584 $ 5,781 8.7 % (20.7) % Operating expenses are summarized below (amounts in millions, except percentages): Year Ended December 31, As a Percentage of Net sales 2024 2023 2022 2024 2023 2022 Selling and marketing $ 600 $ 581 $ 607 12.0 % 12.7 % 10.5 % Research and development 563 519 570 11.3 % 11.3 % 9.9 % General and administrative 381 334 375 7.6 % 7.3 % 6.5 % Settlement and related costs \u2014 \u2014 372 \u2014 % \u2014 % 6.4 % Amortization of intangible assets 104 104 136 NM NM NM Acquisition and integration costs 6 6 21 NM NM NM Exit and restructuring costs 17 98 14 NM NM NM Total Operating expenses $ 1,671 $ 1,642 $ 2,095 33.5 % 35.8 % 36.2 % Consolidated Organic Net sales growth (decline): Year Ended December 31, 2024 2023 Reported GAAP Consolidated Net sales growth (decline) 8.7 % (20.7) % Adjustments: Impact of foreign currency translations (1) (0.6) % 1.4 % Impact of acquisitions (2) \u2014 % (0.5) % Consolidated Organic Net sales growth (decline) (3) 8.1 % (19.8) % (1) Operating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period as well as removing realized cash flow hedge gains and losses from both the current and prior year periods. 31 Table of Contents (2) For purposes of computing Organic Net sales growth (decline), amounts directly attributable to business acquisitions are excluded for twelve months following their respective acquisitions. (3) Consolidated Organic Net sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item. 2024 compared to 2023 Total Net sales increased $397 million or 8.7% compared to the prior year reflecting growth in our EVM segment that was partially offset by a slight decline in our AIT segment as the current year recovery in demand trends benefited EVM earlier in the year than AIT. Excluding the effects of foreign currency changes and acquisitions, Consolidated Organic Net sales increased by 8.1%. Gross margin increased to 48.4% for the current year compared to 46.3% in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to volume leverage, higher service and software margins, lower freight rates, and lower inventory-related charges. Gross margin was higher in both segments, particularly EVM. Operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $1,671 million and $1,642 million, or 33.5% and 35.8% of Net sales, respectively. Current year Operating expenses were higher than the prior year primarily due to higher incentive compensation, partially offset by lower Exit and restructuring costs and incremental savings largely attributed to our Exit and restructuring actions. Operating income was $742 million for the current year compared to $481 million for the prior year. The increase was due to higher Gross profit partially offset by higher Operating expenses. Net income increased 78.4% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher Operating income, as described above, as well as lower Interest (expense) income, net which included higher interest rate swap gains and interest income in the current year. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were 16.9% and 11.4%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to lower rate benefits from tax credits and discrete items as well as higher state income taxes. Diluted earnings per share increased to $10.18 as compared to $5.72 in the prior year primarily due to higher Net income. Results of Operations by Segment The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each reportable business segment as detailed in Note 20, Segment Information & Geographic Data in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. To the extent applicable, segment operating income excludes Amortization of intangible assets, Acquisition and integration costs, Exit and restructuring costs, as well as certain other non-recurring costs (such as the Settlement costs in 2022, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, and business acquisition purchase accounting adjustments).

Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period as well as removing realized cash flow hedge gains and losses from both the current and prior year periods. (2) AIT Organic Net sales (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item. 2024 compared to 2023 Total Net sales for AIT decreased $4 million or 0.2% compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales of printing products and supplies, partially offset by favorable foreign currency changes and higher sales of RFID products. Excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, AIT Organic Net sales decreased by 0.9%. Gross margin increased to 48.1% in the current year compared to 47.7% for the prior year primarily due to favorable foreign currency changes, partially offset by higher inventory-related charges. Operating income decreased 3.2% in the current year compared to the prior year due to higher Operating expenses partially offset by higher Gross profit.

This impact is calculated by 33 Table of Contents translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period as well as removing realized cash flow hedge gains and losses from both the current and prior year periods. (2) For purposes of computing EVM Organic Net sales growth (decline), amounts directly attributable to business acquisitions are excluded for twelve months following their respective acquisitions. (3) EVM Organic Net sales growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Measures section at the end of this item. 2024 compared to 2023 Total Net sales for EVM increased $401 million or 13.7% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales of mobile computing products, and services and software, partially offset by lower sales of data capture products. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency changes and acquisitions, EVM Organic Net sales increased by 13.2%. Gross margin increased to 48.6% in the current year compared to 45.6% for the prior year primarily due to volume leverage, favorable business mix, higher service and software margins, lower inventory-related charges, and lower freight rates. Operating income for the current year increased 55.7% compared to the prior year due to higher Gross profit partially offset by higher Operating expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary factors that influence our liquidity include the amount and timing of cash collections from our customers, cash payments to our suppliers, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and share repurchases. Management believes that our existing capital resources, inclusive of available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities and funds generated from operations, are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness. The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years indicated (in millions): Year Ended December\u00a031, $ Change 2024 vs 2023 $ Change 2023 vs 2022 2024 2023 2022 Cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,013 $ (4) $ 488 $ 1,017 $ (492) Investing activities (57) (92) (968) 35 876 Financing activities (190) 117 253 (307) (136) Effect of exchange rates on cash balances (3) \u2014 \u2014 (3) \u2014 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ 763 $ 21 $ (227) $ 742 $ 248 2024 vs. 2023 The change in our cash and cash equivalents balance during the current year is reflective of the following: \u2022 $1,017 million change in operating activities primarily due to the timing of cash payments and the reduction of overall inventory levels, lower legal settlement, income tax, and employee incentive compensation payments, higher cash receipts on interest rate swaps attributed to the termination of those agreements, as well as overall improved operating profits. \u2022 $307 million change in financing activities primarily due to current year net debt repayments as a portion of the recently issued Senior Notes was utilized to reduce total debt, compared to net borrowings in the prior year. 34 Table of Contents Company Debt The following table shows the carrying value of the Company\u2019s debt (in millions): December 31, 2024 2023 Term Loan A $ 1,575 $ 1,684 Senior Notes 500 \u2014 Revolving Credit Facility \u2014 413 Receivables Financing Facilities 108 129 Total debt $ 2,183 $ 2,226 Less: Debt issuance costs (9) (2) Less: Unamortized discounts (3) (4) Less: Current portion of debt (79) (173) Total long-term debt $ 2,092 $ 2,047 Term Loan A The principal on Term Loan A is due in quarterly installments, with the next quarterly installment due in the second quarter of 2026 and the majority due upon maturity in 2027. The Company has and may make prepayments in whole or in part, without premium or penalty; and would be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Term Loan A interest rate was 5.71%. Interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin. Senior Notes In the second quarter of 2024, the Company completed a private offering of $500\u00a0million senior unsecured notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) with a 6.5% fixed interest rate. The net proceeds of the issuance, after deducting debt issuance costs which were deferred, were approximately $492\u00a0million. The Senior Notes mature on June\u00a01, 2032, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December of each year, commencing on December 1, 2024. The Company may make prepayments in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and would be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of Zebra\u2019s existing and future subsidiaries. The Senior Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of Zebra to: (i) grant or incur liens; (ii) have its subsidiaries guarantee debt without becoming guarantors; and (iii) merge or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of its assets. Revolving Credit Facility The Company has a Revolving Credit Facility that is available for working capital and other general business purposes, including letters of credit. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Company had letters of credit totaling $10 million, which reduced funds available for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1,500 million to $1,490 million. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Revolving Credit Facility had an average interest rate of 5.68%.\u00a0Upon borrowing, interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on May\u00a025, 2027. Receivables Financing Facility As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Company has a Receivables Financing Facility with a borrowing limit of up to $180 million. As collateral, the Company pledges perfected first-priority security interests in its U.S. domestically originated accounts receivable. The Company has accounted for transactions under this facility as secured borrowings. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company amended this facility to extend the maturity to March\u00a019, 2027 but otherwise did not substantially change the terms of the facility. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $638 million of gross receivables that were pledged under the facility. As of December\u00a031, 2024, $108 million had been borrowed, of which $79 million was classified as current. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of\u00a0December\u00a031, 2024, the facility had an average interest rate of\u00a05.38%. Interest is paid monthly on these borrowings. See Note 12, Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Company\u2019s debt instruments. 35 Table of Contents Receivables Factoring The Company has a Receivables Factoring arrangement, pursuant to which certain receivables originated from the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions up to a maximum of \u20ac75\u00a0million, as amended, are sold to a bank without recourse in exchange for cash. Transactions under the Receivables Factoring arrangement are accounted for as sales and the related receivables are removed from the Company\u2019s balance sheet. The Company does not maintain any beneficial interest in the receivables sold. The bank\u2019s purchase of eligible receivables is subject to a maximum amount of uncollected receivables. The Company services the receivables on behalf of the bank, but otherwise maintains no significant continuing involvement with respect to the receivables. Sale proceeds that are representative of the fair value of factored receivables, less a factoring fee, are reflected in Cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while sale proceeds in excess of the fair value of factored receivables are reflected in Cash flows from financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, there were a total of $28 million and $56 million, respectively, of uncollected receivables that had been sold and removed from the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As servicer of sold receivables, the Company had $51 million and $112 million of obligations that were not yet remitted to the bank as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These obligations are included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in such obligations reflected within Cash flows from financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 19, Accounts Receivable Factoring in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. Share Repurchases On May 17, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $1 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock. The authorized share repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date.\u00a0The level of the Company\u2019s repurchases depends on a number of factors, including its financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors its management may deem relevant. The timing, volume, and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases may be affected from time to time through open market purchases, including pursuant to a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, the Company repurchased 130,560 shares of common stock for approximately $47 million. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Company has cumulatively repurchased 539,574 shares of common stock for approximately $154 million, resulting in a remaining amount of share repurchases authorized under the plans of $846 million. Subsequent to the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, the Company has repurchased 128,466 shares of common stock for approximately $50 million through February\u00a06, 2025. Future Cash Requirements We believe that our Cash and cash equivalents, which totaled $901 million as of December\u00a031, 2024, along with anticipated cash generation from operations and available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities, will be sufficient to fund the Company\u2019s cash requirements during the next 12 months and thereafter based on our current business plans. Included in the Company\u2019s Cash and cash equivalents are amounts held by foreign subsidiaries, which was $52 million and $33 million as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We do not expect that Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries will need to be repatriated to fund the Company\u2019s U.S. operations based on current cash requirements. Our cash requirements during the next 12 months and thereafter include payments to satisfy the following obligations: \u2022 Purchase obligations \u2014 The Company has a limited number of multi-year purchase commitments, primarily related to semiconductors and cloud services, which contain minimum purchase requirements and are non-cancellable. As of December\u00a031, 2024, these multi-year commitments were approximately $138 million. This amount excludes routine purchase orders for goods and services, as well as amounts already reflected within Current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 14, Accrued Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. \u2022 Debt obligations \u2014 We expect to make total payments of approximately $210 million associated with the Company\u2019s debt facilities in 2025. This expected use of cash is based on the Company\u2019s current borrowings and applicable interest rates and margins as of December\u00a031, 2024, and includes principal and interest payments. In the ordinary course of business, the Company may decide to borrow additional amounts or repay principal earlier than contractually owed, which would affect future cash payments. See Note 12, Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Company\u2019s debt facilities. 36 Table of Contents \u2022 Leases obligations \u2014 We lease various manufacturing and repair facilities, distribution centers, research facilities, sales and administrative offices, equipment, and vehicles. As of December\u00a031, 2024, the Company\u2019s fixed lease commitments totaled $233 million, of which $46 million is payable in 2025. See Note 13, Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details related to the Company\u2019s lease arrangements. In addition to the expected cash requirements described above, the Company may use cash to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, or repurchase common stock under its share repurchase program. We also expect to spend approximately $60 million to $70 million on capital expenditures in 2025. Critical Accounting Estimates Management prepared the consolidated financial statements of the Company under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The application of these principles requires the use of estimates which affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. While we believe that our estimates are reasonable based upon available information, actual results could differ substantially from those estimates. Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional discussion of these items along with other significant accounting policies of the Company. The accounting estimates described below have been identified by Management as those that are most significant to our financial statements. Income Taxes We estimate a provision or benefit for income taxes and amounts to be settled or recovered in several tax jurisdictions globally. Our estimates are complex and involve significant judgments and interpretations of regulations. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for several years after completion of a given year. We are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis, which requires estimation of our ability to generate future taxable income. In particular, our income tax provision or benefit is dependent on our ability to forecast future taxable income in the U.S., U.K., Singapore, and other jurisdictions. Significant judgments included in our forecasts include projecting future sales volumes and pricing, costs to manufacture and procure products and to deliver offerings, among other factors. There were no significant changes in estimates to our income tax provision during the current year. Acquisitions We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that the purchase price be allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The estimates used to determine the fair values of long-lived intangible assets can be complex and require judgment. We generally value intangible assets using income-based valuation methodologies, such as the excess earnings method, which require critical estimates that include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from revenues and the determination of discount rates. Goodwill Impairment Our goodwill impairment testing includes a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value. Fair value determinations require judgment and can be sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, as well as market factors. We estimate the fair value of reporting units using both income and market-based valuation approaches. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires that we make assumptions and estimates including projections of revenue and income growth rates as well as cash flows; capital investments; competitive and customer trends; appropriate peer group selection; market-based discount rates and other market factors. Our annual impairment testing, most recently completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, continues to indicate that the fair values of each of our reporting units significantly exceed their respective carrying values. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised offerings to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive. The consideration that we expect to receive is estimated by reflecting reductions to our transaction price for product returns, rebates, and other incentives. These estimates are developed using the expected value that the Company anticipates receiving and are based on recent trends observed in similar transactions. Additionally, some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, including various hardware, software, and\/or services. For such contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the estimated total transaction price to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices (\u201cSSP\u201d). The determination of SSP is established at a regional level. SSP is based on observable prices in recent standalone transactions for the same or similar offerings, to the extent available, which is often applicable to tangible products and software licenses. Alternatively, in the absence of recent observable prices, the Company generally applies the expected cost-plus margin approach to professional services, repair and maintenance services, and solution offerings. There were no changes to our estimation processes for consideration received or SSP that materially affected revenues during the year. 37 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements. Non-GAAP Measures The Company has provided reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures \u2013 Consolidated Organic Net sales growth (decline), AIT Organic Net sales (decline), and EVM Organic Net sales growth (decline) \u2013 are presented because our management evaluates our financial results both including and excluding the effects of business acquisitions and foreign currency translation, as applicable. Management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of our business from period to period and trends in our historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures presented. 38 Table of Contents\n---\n**Question:** What forward-looking statements or expectations does management provide regarding future performance, strategy, or market conditions (while noting these are subject to disclaimers)?",

Zebra is primarily exposed to the following types of market risk: interest rate and foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances. Our exposure is primarily tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). We periodically use interest rate derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, to mitigate the Company\u2019s exposure from interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances, thereby reducing the volatility of our financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, fix a portion of variable rate debt. Generally, under these interest rate swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange variable rate for fixed rate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional amount. As of December\u00a031, 2024, approximately $1.7 billion of our $2.2 billion of total debt outstanding had interest determined by reference to a variable rate index. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately $17 million. Refer to Note 11, Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these risk mitigation activities. Exposure to variable interest may increase or decrease, to the extent that the Company\u2019s borrowings under its debt facilities increase or decrease, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk We provide offerings in approximately 176 countries throughout the world and, therefore, at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates. In some instances, we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable. We also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies. We manage these risks using derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency exchange contracts. See Note 11, Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of hedging activities. The currencies that we are primarily exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are the Euro, British Pound Sterling, and Czech Koruna. A one percentage point increase or decrease in exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar would increase or decrease our pre-tax income by approximately $1 million.

Generally, under these interest rate swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange variable rate for fixed rate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional amount. As of December\u00a031, 2024, approximately $1.7 billion of our $2.2 billion of total debt outstanding had interest determined by reference to a variable rate index. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately $17 million. Refer to Note 11, Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these risk mitigation activities. Exposure to variable interest may increase or decrease, to the extent that the Company\u2019s borrowings under its debt facilities increase or decrease, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk We provide offerings in approximately 176 countries throughout the world and, therefore, at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates. In some instances, we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable. We also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies. We manage these risks using derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency exchange contracts. See Note 11, Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of hedging activities. The currencies that we are primarily exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are the Euro, British Pound Sterling, and Czech Koruna. A one percentage point increase or decrease in exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar would increase or decrease our pre-tax income by approximately $1 million.

While this demonstrates prudent financial management and helps mitigate volatility in financing costs, it does not clearly align with any of Hamilton Helmer's 7 Powers. There is no indication of declining per-unit costs with volume (Scale Economies), increasing value with more users (Network Economies), a superior new business model (Counter-Positioning), customer value loss from switching suppliers (Switching Costs), a premium brand (Branding), preferential access to a unique asset (Cornered Resource), or deeply embedded, difficult-to-match processes that provide a sustained competitive advantage beyond standard financial practice (Process Power). The utilization of interest rate swaps is a common financial hedging technique, and the text provides no evidence that Zebra Technologies possesses a unique, difficult-to-replicate, or superior process in this regard that creates a durable barrier to competition. It is a necessary operational detail for managing financial liabilities, not a source of competitive power in the Helmer framework."

We periodically use interest rate derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, to mitigate the Company\u2019s exposure from interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances, thereby reducing the volatility of our financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, fix a portion of variable rate debt. Generally, under these interest rate swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange variable rate for fixed rate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional amount. As of December\u00a031, 2024, approximately $1.7 billion of our $2.2 billion of total debt outstanding had interest determined by reference to a variable rate index. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately $17 million. Refer to Note 11, Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these risk mitigation activities. Exposure to variable interest may increase or decrease, to the extent that the Company\u2019s borrowings under its debt facilities increase or decrease, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk We provide offerings in approximately 176 countries throughout the world and, therefore, at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates. In some instances, we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable. We also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies. We manage these risks using derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency exchange contracts. See Note 11, Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of hedging activities. The currencies that we are primarily exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are the Euro, British Pound Sterling, and Czech Koruna. A one percentage point increase or decrease in exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar would increase or decrease our pre-tax income by approximately $1 million. This amount is inclusive of the impact of associated derivative contracts. 39 Table of Contents",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Text:**\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and foreign currency changes. Zebra is primarily exposed to the following types of market risk: interest rate and foreign currency. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances. Our exposure is primarily tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). We periodically use interest rate derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, to mitigate the Company\u2019s exposure from interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances, thereby reducing the volatility of our financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, fix a portion of variable rate debt. Generally, under these interest rate swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange variable rate for fixed rate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional amount. As of December\u00a031, 2024, approximately $1.7 billion of our $2.2 billion of total debt outstanding had interest determined by reference to a variable rate index. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately $17 million. Refer to Note 11, Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these risk mitigation activities. Exposure to variable interest may increase or decrease, to the extent that the Company\u2019s borrowings under its debt facilities increase or decrease, respectively. Foreign Exchange Risk We provide offerings in approximately 176 countries throughout the world and, therefore, at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates. In some instances, we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable. We also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies. We manage these risks using derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency exchange contracts. See Note 11, Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of hedging activities. The currencies that we are primarily exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are the Euro, British Pound Sterling, and Czech Koruna. A one percentage point increase or decrease in exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar would increase or decrease our pre-tax income by approximately $1 million. This amount is inclusive of the impact of associated derivative contracts. 39 Table of Contents\n---\n**Question:** Does Zebra Technologies discuss any limitations of its market risk disclosures or the models used for sensitivity analysis?",
